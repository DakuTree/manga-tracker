	<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR">AllMangasReader</a>, for the initial idea, as well as the base of topbar & site-specific code.
		<br>
		<a href="http://www.novelupdates.com/">Novel Updates</a>, for improving on the idea of a server-side tracker (and actually doing it well!). Also for the tracker look/design.
		<br>

	<h3>Support the Project</h3>
	<p>
		Want to support the site? Stop. Go support the actual manga industry instead!
		<br>
		Honestly though, if you <i>really</i> want to support us in a monetary way, you can use sign-up to DigitalOcean using our <a href="https://m.do.co/c/c3cbfcfa7e27">referral link</a>, and we get $25 credit after you spend $25.
		Only do this if you're actually going to use it though, would rather the cash went to the industry.
		<br>
		If you want to support us in a non-monetary way however, spreading the word about the site is always a nice help.
		<br>
		Starring the project on <a href="https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker">Github</a>, or giving me a follow on <a href="https://twitter.com/DakuTree">Twitter</a> is also appreciated.
