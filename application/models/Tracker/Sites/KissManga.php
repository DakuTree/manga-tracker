	/* This site is a massive pain in the ass. The only reason I'm supporting it is it's one of the few aggregator sites which actually support more risquÃ© manga.
	   The main problem with this site is it has some form of bot protection. To view any part of the site normally, you need a cookie set by the bot protection.

	   To generate this cookie, we need three variables. Two are static, but the other is generated by randomly generated JS on the page.
	   The randomly generated JS is the troublesome part. We can't easily parse this with PHP. Both V8JS & SpiderMonkey refuse to build properly for me, so that rules that out.
	   The other option is using regex, but that is a rabbit hole I don't want to touch with a ten-foot pole.

	   To make the entire site work, I've built a python script to handle grabbing this cookie. This is grabbed & updated at the same time the manga are updated. The script saves the cookiejar which the PHP later reads.
	   The cookie has a length of 1 year, but I don't think it actually lasts that long, so we update every 6hours instead.
	   I should probably also mention that the cookie generated also uses your user-agent, so if it changes the cookie will break.
