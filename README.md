# manga-tracker
A cross-site manga tracker. Inspired by [AllMangasReader](https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR) and [NovelUpdates](https://www.novelupdates.com/).  
This site is intended to be used alongside a [userscript](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/raw/master/public/userscripts/manga-tracker.user.js).

A full CHANGELOG of what is currently implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/wiki/Changelog).
