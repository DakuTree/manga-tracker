# manga-tracker
A WIP cross-site manga tracker. Inspired by [AllMangasReader](https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR) and [NovelUpdates](http://www.novelupdates.com/).  
This site is intended to be used alongside a [userscript](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/raw/master/public/userscripts/manga-tracker.user.js).

## Project Status.
**WIP (But usable!)**. The tracker itself works fine, but the site still needs some work design wise, and there is still a bunch I'd like to do before 1.0.  
I will stress that since this is still WIP, I can't guarantee loss of data due to bugs and what not. Use the backup feature often.

A full CHANGELOG of what is currently implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/blob/master/public/CHANGELOG.md).

## How to use
1. Install the  [userscript](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/raw/master/public/userscripts/manga-tracker.user.js).
2. Register on the site.
3. Login & go to user/options to grab your API-Key.
4. You're good to go!
