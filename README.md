# manga-tracker
A WIP cross-site manga tracker. Inspired by [AllMangasReader](https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR) and [NovelUpdates](http://www.novelupdates.com/).  
This site is intended to be used alongside a [userscript](hhttps://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/raw/master/public/userscripts/manga-tracker.user.js).

## Project Status.
Although the site is still very much WIP, it is usable. A full CHANGELOG of what is currently implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/DakuTree/manga-tracker/blob/master/public/CHANGELOG.md).  
I will stress that as this is still WIP, I can't guarantee loss of data due to bugs and what not.
